curl http://localhost:8000/admin/health
```

## Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Overall status: `healthy` or `degraded`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="providers" type="object">
  Status of each provider
</ResponseField>

## Example Response (Healthy)

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "providers": {
    "postgres": "healthy",
    "opensearch": "healthy"
  }
}
```

## Example Response (Degraded)

```json

## Provider Status Values

| Status | Description |

| `unhealthy` | Provider is not responding |
| `error: <message>` | Provider returned an error |

## Use Cases

### Kubernetes Liveness Probe

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /admin/health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 30
```

### Load Balancer Health Check

Configure your load balancer to check `/admin/health` and route traffic only to healthy instances.

### Monitoring

Poll the health endpoint and alert when status is `degraded`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
STATUS=$(curl -s http://localhost:8000/admin/health | jq -r '.status')
if [ "$STATUS" != "healthy" ]; then
  echo "ALERT: cogmem-kos is degraded"
fi
```
