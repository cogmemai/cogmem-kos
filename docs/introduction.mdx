# CogMem: A Self-Evolving Knowledge Operating System

Most LLM memory systems focus on recall.

**CogMem focuses on knowledge formation — and learns how to do it better over time.**

CogMem is a Personal Knowledge Operating System (KOS): a long-running cognitive system that ingests messy personal data—notes, documents, conversations, web content—and incrementally transforms it into structured, inspectable, and reusable knowledge.

What makes CogMem unique is that it doesn't just store knowledge — it **evolves how it organizes, retrieves, and restructures knowledge** based on observed outcomes. The system learns which memory strategies work best for your domain and adapts its own data structures accordingly.

## Why CogMem Exists

LLMs are powerful, but their default memory model is fragile:

- **Context windows are short**
- **Chat history is unstructured**
- **Important facts are overwritten or forgotten**
- **Contradictions accumulate silently**
- **Knowledge is not inspectable or explainable**
- **Memory strategies are fixed** — the same approach is used regardless of domain

CogMem addresses this by introducing a **Knowledge Kernel** that governs how information becomes knowledge, and an **Adaptive Cognitive Plane** that learns how to organize that knowledge more effectively over time.

## The Knowledge Kernel

At the center of CogMem is a **Knowledge Kernel**: a persistent, deterministic system responsible for how memory is formed, structured, and maintained.

<Note>
The Knowledge Kernel is not an agent.
It does not generate text.
It governs knowledge lifecycle.
</Note>

The kernel is responsible for:

- **Admission control** — deciding what information is worth remembering
- **Transformation** — promoting raw data into structured representations
- **Conflict tracking** — identifying and retaining competing claims
- **Maintenance** — merging, decaying, refreshing, and reinforcing memories
- **Governance** — tracking source, confidence, and scope of knowledge

Agents interact through the kernel, but do not own memory themselves.

## The Adaptive Cognitive Plane

Above the Knowledge Kernel sits the **Adaptive Cognitive Plane (ACP)** — a self-evolving control layer that learns how to organize knowledge more effectively.

<Warning>
The ACP is advisory, not autonomous. Every structural change is proposed, evaluated, and reversible. The Knowledge Kernel remains deterministic and auditable at its core.
</Warning>

The ACP introduces three key capabilities:

- **Memory Strategies** — explicit, versioned hypotheses about how to chunk, index, retrieve, and maintain knowledge for a given domain
- **Outcome Signals** — feedback loops that capture how well the system performed (retrieval success, user corrections, latency, cost)
- **Self-Restructuring** — safe, auditable changes to data structures when the system detects a better approach

This means CogMem doesn't just store your knowledge — it **discovers the best way to store it** for your specific use case.

### Structure as a Hypothesis

Traditional systems treat their data structures as fixed. CogMem treats every structural choice — chunking strategy, retrieval mode, graph schema, claim predicates — as a **testable hypothesis**.

| Component | Fixed Systems | CogMem |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Chunk size | Hardcoded at 500 chars | Adapts per domain based on retrieval outcomes |
| Retrieval mode | Always vector search | Learns whether FTS, vector, graph, or hybrid works best |
| Graph schema | Static edge types | Adds/removes edge types based on utilization |
| Claim predicates | Developer-defined | Evolves based on what the data actually contains |

### Safety by Design

Self-evolving systems require strong safety guarantees. CogMem enforces:

- **Every change is a proposal** — the Meta-Kernel proposes, it never executes directly
- **Every change is reversible** — base strategies are preserved for rollback
- **Every change is auditable** — all decisions emit kernel events with rationale
- **Evaluation windows** — new strategies are observed before being confirmed
- **No autonomous code modification** — ACP changes data structures, never code
- **No opaque mutations** — every structural change is logged and explainable

## Knowledge Formation Pipeline

CogMem organizes personal data through a multi-stage pipeline:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Items** | Raw ingested objects such as files, notes, emails, chat logs, or web pages |
| **Passages** | Semantically meaningful fragments extracted from items (chunking strategy governed by active MemoryStrategy) |
| **Entities** | Canonical representations of people, projects, concepts, tools, or places |
| **Claims** | Structured assertions derived from passages, each with evidence and confidence |
| **Artifacts** | Human-readable outputs such as personal wiki pages, timelines, briefings, or decision logs |

Each stage is inspectable, auditable, and subject to restructuring by the Adaptive Cognitive Plane.

## Evidence-First Memory

CogMem treats **claims**, not text, as the core unit of memory.

Every claim stores:

- **Supporting passages** — the evidence
- **Source** — user-asserted, inferred, or retrieved
- **Timestamp** — when it was learned
- **Confidence** — how certain the system is
- **Conflicts** — other claims that contradict it

<Warning>
Contradictions are preserved, not overwritten.
</Warning>

This enables the system to explain *why* it believes something and *what evidence* supports it.

## Knowledge Workflows

Instead of ad-hoc retrieval, CogMem introduces **Knowledge Workflows** — repeatable strategies governed by the active MemoryStrategy.

A workflow transforms stored knowledge into useful artifacts:

- **Personal Wikipedia pages** — entity dossiers with facts and evidence
- **Project timelines** — ordered claims/events over time
- **Decision histories** — how and why decisions were made
- **Cross-source summaries** — unified views across documents
- **Contradiction reports** — surface conflicting claims for review

Workflows are first-class, versioned, inspectable, and strategy-aware.

## Inspectability by Design

CogMem is designed to be **debuggable** — especially important for a self-evolving system.

Developers and users can inspect:

- Raw tables of items, passages, entities, and claims
- Graph relationships between entities
- Evidence trails for any conclusion
- The event stream of kernel decisions
- **Active memory strategies** and their version history
- **Outcome signals** that triggered strategy changes
- **Restructuring proposals** with rationale and risk assessment

This makes CogMem suitable for research, long-term use, and explainable reasoning.

## Solo Mode (Recommended)

CogMem is designed to run as a personal system.

In **Solo Mode**, all memory, embeddings, graph data, and strategy state can live locally in a single database, enabling:

- **Privacy** — your data stays on your device
- **Offline operation** — no cloud dependency
- **Iterative experimentation** — rapid development cycles
- **Dissertation-friendly evaluation** — reproducible research
- **Local self-evolution** — the system adapts to your domain without cloud calls

## Framework-Agnostic by Design

CogMem does not replace agent frameworks—it supports them.

LangGraph, CrewAI, or custom agents can interact with CogMem as clients, relying on the Knowledge Kernel to handle memory, structure, and recall consistently over time. The Adaptive Cognitive Plane works transparently beneath these integrations.

## Summary

CogMem is not a chat memory store.
It is not a workflow engine.

**It is a self-evolving knowledge operating system** — a cognitive substrate that transforms unorganized personal data into structured, explainable, and evolving knowledge, and learns to do it better over time.
