# Build with cogmem-kos

A multi-agent framework centered around a **personalized planning agent** with cognitive memory. cogmem-kos addresses the critical gap in current LLM agent systems: the lack of persistent, user-specific memory that enables agents to learn and improve over time.

## What is cogmem-kos?

cogmem-kos is a **Knowledge Operating System kernel** built around a central insight: LLM agents need personalized memory to plan effectively. At its heart is the **Personal Planning Agent**—a cognitive agent with its own memory database that orchestrates other agents to complete complex tasks.

### The Personal Planning Agent

The personal planning agent is the **central orchestrator** of the cogmem-kos framework. Unlike traditional multi-agent systems that pass entire conversation histories through prompts, our planning agent:

- **Maintains persistent memory** - User-specific knowledge that persists across sessions
- **Plans with context** - Uses past experiences to create better action plans
- **Orchestrates agents** - Coordinates specialized agents (chunking, embedding, extraction) to execute tasks
- **Self-improves over time** - Learns from completed actions to enhance future performance

This architecture reduces token consumption, improves task success rates, and enables coherent long-term strategies.

### Core Capabilities

- **Agent Subsystem** - Event-driven agents with the personal planning agent at the center
- **Cognitive Memory** - Personalized, persistent memory architecture for learning and adaptation
- **Unified Retrieval** - Text search, vector search, and graph traversal through a single API
- **Entity Graph** - Automatic entity extraction and Wikipedia-style entity pages
- **Framework Agnostic** - Works with LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or any framework

## Deployment Modes

## Core Concepts

### Items & Passages

**Items** are your source documents (emails, files, notes). They get chunked into **Passages** for search and embedding.

### Entities

Named entities (people, organizations, concepts) are extracted from passages and linked in a knowledge graph.

### Retrieval Plans

Pre-built retrieval strategies that orchestrate multiple search backends:

- **Search First** - Lexical search → hydrate → graph expansion
- **Wikipedia Page** - Entity-centric view with facts and evidence
- **Semantic First** - Vector search → rerank → hydrate

## Why Personal Planning?

Current multi-agent frameworks suffer from a critical limitation: they lack persistent memory. Each interaction starts fresh, requiring agents to rebuild context from scratch. This leads to:

- **Excessive token consumption** - Entire conversation histories passed with each prompt
- **Incoherent strategies** - Agents cannot maintain long-term plans
- **No learning** - Past successes and failures are forgotten

The personal planning agent solves these problems by maintaining a cognitive memory database specific to each user, enabling the framework to learn, adapt, and improve over time.
